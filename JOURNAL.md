TOTAL TIME TAKEN: 18H + 80H (prev projects)


Are we rollin' bois?..

Entry A: Speed Run To completion.

WOWEE! A THIRD KEEB DONE!! IN ONE DAY!!
(ofc it did take like 80 hours previously when making keebs. (thats how long it took my first one) but after reusing parts and info (since I'm only allowed to submit one keyboard) I somewhat totalled all the time into one.
I completed the schematic, pcb, cad and item research. totalling to under 150 dollars!
I worked non stop for this lmao but I'm glad I did. this is one of the things I'm proud to make and proud to keep in my home forever!
Here are some images, BOMS can be found in the BOM in this repository and every thing else needed for this submission to work!
Thanks for reading! I'll update when I get all the items!
